# Common Issues and Solutions

## Pairing File Issue -9

- **Issue:** This error may occur if the pairing file has been modified or if a new pairing file was created.
- **Solution:**  
  Generate a new pairing file using JitterbugPair and retry the process.

## Keeping the IPA Up-to-Date

- **Issue:** StikJIT/StikDebug is frequently updated with bug fixes.
- **Recommendation:**  
  Check for updates in your installation store method or reinstall the latest IPA (if applicable) every 1–2 days to ensure optimal performance.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **Does this work with LiveContainer?**  
  Yes, it can be used both standalone or inside LiveContianer.

- **Do I need to be connected to Wi-Fi?**  
The first launch requires Wi-Fi to mount the DDI. After that you can use Wi-Fi or Airplane Mode.

- **Can this be used with a certificate?**  
  Yes, it has to be used with a developer certificate. Distribution and enterprise certificates will **NOT** work.

- **Is this open source?**  
  Yes, the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/StephenDev0/StikJIT).

- **What iOS versions are supported?**  
  Supported versions range from iOS 17.4 to iOS 18.5 Developer Beta 2 (latest version).

- **Will devices with versions below iOS 17.4 work?**  
  No, an update to iOS 17.4 or higher is required.

- **Does iOS 18.4 beta 1 work?**  
  No, Apple broke JIT in this version. You should update. 

- **Is WireGuard still an option, or is StosVPN required?**  
StosVPN is required for StikJIT to work properly. It is not needed for StikDebug because the VPN is built in.
